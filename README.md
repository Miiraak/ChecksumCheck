# ChecksumCheck

## Description

ChecksumCheck is a simple application that allows you to verify the integrity of files or calculating their checksums (hashes) using multiple cryptographic algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512). The user can select a file and then enter the expected checksum values to compare with those generated by the application.

The project uses several algorithms to compute hashes and highlights whether the generated hashes match the ones provided by the user.

## Features
- **File Selection**: Allows the user to choose a file whose integrity will be checked.
- **Hash Calculation**: Supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 algorithms for checksum calculation.
- **Integrity Verification**: Compares the generated hashes with those provided by the user and highlights whether the file is valid.
- **Intuitive Interface**: A simple and easy-to-use interface allowing the user to select a file and compare the hashes.

### Features in development/backlog
|||
|---|---|
| **Feature #1** | Additional support for more hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-3). | 
| **Feature #2** | Performance optimization for large files. |
| ~~**Feature #3**~~ | ~~Show the computed hash value if textfield is empty.~~ |

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Microsoft .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) 4.7.2 or higher

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Click the **Select** button to select the file you want to verify.
5. Check the boxes for the algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512) you want to use for verification or calculation.
6. Enter in the corresponding field the provided checksum. Let empty to calculate the checksum.
6. Click **Check** to compare and calculate hashes. If the hashes match, the fields turn green; otherwise, they turn red.
7. To reset, click **Clear** to clear all fields and disable the options.
